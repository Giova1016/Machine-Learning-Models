This repository contains various prediction and classification models developed for the "Intro to Machine Learning" course. The projects are implemented entirely in **Jupyter Notebook**, showcasing the implementation and testing of different machine learning algorithms and techniques.

### Guide to Download and Test the Projects
This simple guide will help you set up and explore the machine learning models in this repository.

#### 1. Clone the Repository
To download the repository, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your system. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Giova1016/Machine-Learning-Models.git
```

#### 2. Open the Project in Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Notebook
- **Using Visual Studio Code**:
  1. Install the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) in VS Code.
  2. Install the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) in VS Code.
  3. Open the cloned folder in VS Code:
     ```bash
     code Machine-Learning-Models
     ```
  4. Ensure you have Jupyter installed by running:
     ```bash
     pip install notebook
     ```
  5. Open any `.ipynb` file directly in VS Code.

- **Using Jupyter Notebook**:
  1. Navigate to the cloned directory:
     ```bash
     cd Machine-Learning-Models
     ```
  2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
  3. Open the desired `.ipynb` file in the Jupyter Notebook interface.

#### 3. Install Required Dependencies
When running the notebooks for the first time, they include a commented code cell with the required dependencies to run the rest of the cells. Ensure you have installed all the required Python packages.

#### 4. Execute the Notebooks
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the cells in the notebooks to execute the machine learning models and observe their outputs.
